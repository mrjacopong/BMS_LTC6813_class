This collection of libraries has been downloaded in 2018 from Analog Devices.
It has been already modified to work with LTC6813.
I uploaded it here in case of incompatibility, it should work 100%.

INSTUCTIONS:
1. unzip bmsSketchbookBeta where you want.
2. copy EVERYTHING inside the folder "bmsSketchbookBeta" and paste in your arduino's library folder (usually inside "C:\Users\YOURUSER\Documents\Arduino", if not you can google for it)
3. DONE
